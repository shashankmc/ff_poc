However, this should not be the case when the unmanned aircraft is considered to be a toy within the meaning of Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the safety of toys (3).\n\n(17)\tThe information about registration of certified unmanned aircraft and of operators of unmanned aircraft that are subject to a registration requirement should be stored in digital, harmonised, interoperable national registration systems, allowing competent authorities to access and exchange that information. The mechanisms to ensure the interoperability of the national registers in this Regulation should be without prejudice to the rules applicable to the future repository referred to in Article 74 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.\n\n(18)\tIn accordance with paragraph 8 of Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, this Regulation is without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to lay down national rules to make subject to certain conditions the operations of unmanned aircraft for reasons falling outside the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, including public security or protection of privacy and personal data in accordance with the Union law.\n\n(19)\tNational registration systems should comply with the applicable Union and national law on privacy and processing of personal data and the information stored in those registrations systems should be easily accessible (4).\n\n(20)\tUAS operators and remote pilots should ensure that they are adequately informed about applicable Union and national rules relating to the intended operations, in particular with regard to safety, privacy, data protection, liability, insurance, security and environmental protection.\n\n(21)\tSome areas, such as hospitals, gatherings of people, installations and facilities like penal institutions or industrial plants, top-level and higher-level government authorities, nature conservation areas or certain items of transport infrastructure, can be particularly sensitive to some or all types of UAS operations. This should be without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to lay down national rules to make subject to certain conditions the operations of unmanned aircraft for reasons falling outside the scope of this Regulation, including environmental protection, public security or protection of privacy and personal data in accordance with the Union law.\n\n(22)\tUnmanned aircraft noise and emissions should be minimised as far as possible taking into account the operating conditions and various specific characteristics of individual Member States, such as the population density, where noise and emissions are of concern. In order to facilitate the societal acceptance of UAS operations, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 includes maximum level of noise for unmanned aircraft operated close to people in the ‘open’ category. In the ‘specific’ category there is a requirement for the operator to develop guidelines for its remote pilots so that all operations are flown in a manner that minimises nuisances to people and animals.\n\n(23)\tCurrent national certificates should be adapted to certificates complying with the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n(24)\tIn order to ensure the proper implementation of this Regulation, appropriate transitional measures should be established. In particular, Member States and stakeholders should have sufficient time to adapt their procedures to the new regulatory framework before this Regulation applies.\n\n(25)\tThe new regulatory framework for UAS operations should be without prejudice to the applicable environmental and nature protection obligations otherwise stemming from national or Union law.\n\n(26)\tWhile the ‘U-space’ system including the infrastructure, services and procedures to guarantee safe UAS operations and supporting their integration into the aviation system is in development, this Regulation should already include requirements for the implementation of three foundations of the U-space system, namely registration, geo-awareness and remote identification, which will need to be further completed.\n\n(27)\tSince model aircraft are considered as UAS and given the good safety level demonstrated by model aircraft operations in clubs and associations, there should be a seamless transition from the different national systems to the new Union regulatory framework, so that model aircraft clubs and associations can continue to operate as they do today, as well as taking into account existing best practices in the Member States.\n\n(28)\tIn addition, considering the good level of safety achieved by aircraft of class C4 as provided in Annex to this Regulation, low risk operations of such aircraft should be allowed to be conducted in the ‘open’ category. Such aircraft, often used by model aircraft operators, are comparatively simpler than other classes of unmanned aircraft and should therefore not be subject to disproportionate technical requirements.\n\n(29)\tThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established in accordance with Article 127 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n",

third parties or property on the ground could be endangered by the activity;\n\nii.\tthe complexity, performance and operational characteristics of the unmanned aircraft involved;\n\niii.\tthe purpose of the flight, the type of UAS, the probability of collision with other aircraft and class of airspace used;\n\niv.\tthe type, scale, and complexity of the UAS operation or activity, including, where relevant, the size and type of the traffic handled by the responsible organisation or person;\n\nv.\tthe extent to which the persons affected by the risks involved in the UAS operation are able to assess and exercise control over those risks.\n\n(d)\tidentify a range of possible risk mitigating measures;\n\n(e)\tdetermine the necessary level of robustness of the selected mitigating measures in such a way that the operation can be conducted safely.\n\n2.   The description of the UAS operation shall include at least the following:\n\n(a)\tthe nature of the activities performed;\n\n(b)\tthe operational environment and geographical area for the intended operation, in particular overflown population, orography, types of airspace, airspace volume where the operation will take place and which airspace volume is kept as necessary risk buffers, including the operational requirements for geographical zones;\n\n(c)\tthe complexity of the operation, in particular which planning and execution, personnel competencies, experience and composition, required technical means are planned to conduct the operation;\n\n(d)\tthe technical features of the UAS, including its performance in view of the conditions of the planned operation and, where applicable, its registration number;\n\n(e)\tthe competence of the personnel for conducting the operation including their composition, role, responsibilities, training and recent experience.\n\n3.   The assessment shall propose a target level of safety, which shall be equivalent to the safety level in manned aviation, in view of the specific characteristics of UAS operation.\n\n4.   The identification of the risks shall include the determination of all of the below:\n\n(a)\tthe unmitigated ground risk of the operation taking into account the type of operation and the conditions under which the operation takes place, including at least the following criteria:\n\ni.\tVLOS or BVLOS;\n\nii.\tpopulation density of the overflown areas;\n\niii.\tflying over an assembly of people;\n\niv.\tthe dimension characteristics of the unmanned aircraft;\n\n(b)\tthe unmitigated air risk of the operation taking into account all of the below:\n\ni.\tthe exact airspace volume where the operation will take place, extended by a volume of airspace necessary for contingency procedures;\n\nii.\tthe class of the airspace;\n\niii.\tthe impact on other air traffic and air traffic management (ATM) and in particular:\n\n—\tthe altitude of the operation;\n\n—\tcontrolled versus uncontrolled airspace;\n\n—\taerodrome versus non-aerodrome environment;\n\n—\tairspace over urban versus rural environment;\n\n—\tseparation from other traffic.\n\n5.   The identification of the possible mitigation measures necessary to meet the proposed target level of safety shall consider the following possibilities:\n\n(a)\tcontainment measures for people on the ground;\n\n(b)\tstrategic operational limitations to the UAS operation, in particular:\n\ni.\trestricting the geographical volumes where the operation takes place;\n\nii.\trestricting the duration or schedule of the time slot in which the operation takes place;\n\n(c)\tstrategic mitigation by common flight rules or common airspace structure and services;\n\n(d)\tcapability to cope with possible adverse operating conditions;\n\n(e)\torganisation factors such as operational and maintenance procedures elaborated by the UAS operator and maintenance procedures compliant with the manufacturer's user manual;\n\n(f)\tthe level of competency and expertise of the personnel involved in the safety of the flight;\n\n(g)\tthe risk of human error in the application of the operational procedures;\n\n(h)\tthe design features and performance of the UAS in particular:\n\ni.\tthe availability of means to mitigate risks of collision;\n\nii.\tthe availability of systems limiting the energy at impact or the frangibility of the unmanned aircraft;\n\niii.\tthe design of the UAS to recognised standards and the fail-safe design.\n\n6.   The robustness of the proposed mitigating measures shall be assessed in order to determine whether
